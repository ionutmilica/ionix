# Ionix Framework
(Name may change)

Ionix was my try to escape from boring days when I was forced to study for the exams.<br/>
It is a MVC framework heavily inspired by Laravel, a framework that I love (see laravel.com), built for PHP 5.4+ that aims to be fast and very light for simple projects.

For the near future I plan to:

- Add documentation (urgent!)
- Add unit tests for the whole components (urgent!)
- Add new components but keeping the idea of simplicity
- Refactor current components
- Port the framework to Node JS

How to install:

```
composer create-project ionutmilica/ionix <project-name> dev-master
```
